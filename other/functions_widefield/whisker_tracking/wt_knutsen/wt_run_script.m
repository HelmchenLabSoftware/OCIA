% WT_RUN_SCRIPT
% Select a WT script from disk and run it.
%
% Usage:
%
%   wt_run_script()         [default]
%       Run a single script for the currently loaded movie only.
%
%   wt_run_script('batch')
%       Run a single script once for all movies in the current directory.
%       The current directory must already have been selected with File->
%       Open Directory.
%
%       This mode is evoked by selecting Options -> Scripts -> Run Batch
%       Script from the menu.
%
%       Note that this function when run in the default (single movie) mode
%       can also be repeated as a batch job by selecting Options -> Batch
%       Redo from the menu.
% 
%   wt_run_script(SCRIPT)
%       Run the script designated by the string SCRIPT. The script must
%       already exist in the ./scripts folder where WT is installed.
