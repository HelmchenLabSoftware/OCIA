function vVertAngle = wt_get_vertical_angle(mXY, nD, nC)
% WT_GET_VERTICAL_ANGLE Calculate vertical whisker angle.
% The vertical whisker angle is computed from the known distance between
% two labels attached to the whisker shaft.
%
% To use this function the whisker must have a minimum of two labels
% attached to it. The Eucledian distance between the two points must be
% known a priori. This distance can be provided either in units of
% millimeters or pixels. A unit of millimeters will be assumed if the movie
% has already been calibration, whereas a unit of pixels will be assumed if
% the movie has not been calibrated.
%
% Syntax: wt_get_vertical_angle(V, RL, N), where
%          V is a Fx2x2 matrix of [X Y] coordinates of two whisker
%           attached labels
%          D is the known Eucledian distance between labels
%          C is the pixels/mm calibration value (or, NaN)
%
% If C is NaN, the unit of D is assumed to be pixels. Is C is non-NaN, C is
% assumed to be in millimeters
